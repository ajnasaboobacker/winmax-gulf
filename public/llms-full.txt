SECTION 2: PDLC SMART GLASS - COMPLETE TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION
===============================================================================

## What is PDLC Smart Glass?

PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal) Smart Glass, also called switchable glass, smart film, or electronic privacy glass, is an advanced glazing technology that enables instant control over glass transparency.

### How It Works
The technology uses liquid crystals dispersed in a polymer matrix between two conductive layers:
- **Power ON:** Crystals align, allowing light to pass through (transparent)
- **Power OFF:** Crystals scatter randomly, blocking visibility (opaque/frosted)
- **Switching Time:** Less than 100 milliseconds
- **No moving parts, no maintenance required**

### Technical Specifications
